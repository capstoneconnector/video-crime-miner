A description of what all api request will definitely contain so the Angular client knows what to expect

(Below is the same as api-standard.json but for easy copy-paste to javascript/typescript code)

{
	success: true,
	messsage: "message",
	data: [],
	metaData: {
		timeCreated: "01 January 1900 12:00:00AM"
	}
}
