# Chuqlab CrimeMiner Project: Video Processor

# Project Team Members
Jacob Bishop, Merghani Hag Elnour, Eric J Perez, Isaac McKinney, and Brendan May

# Summary: 
Chuqlabâ€™s CrimeMiner currently processes audio and video files for key terms and phrases for investigations. This process is currently only for the audio contained in these videos. For this project we will be developing a means of processing video for key visual elements of the videos.   


# Purpose:
To provide users the ability to search through long videos and identify where key actions are located as well as where different visual elements enter into the video files. 

# Key Features:
- Process every frame of the video and extract important events from the video.
- This will be just a library. Input: video, output: list of timestamped important events in the video.
